# webdev
Select projects from Web Development and Programming course. This course taught the ins and outs of Javascript and JQuery as well as a substantial amount of PHP and MySQL. Web design was not a focus in this course. Coincidentally, I took this class before the web design class so I was able to focus more on the JS, PHP, and MySQL portion of the curriculum.
